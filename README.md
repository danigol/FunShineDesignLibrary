# FunShineDesignLibrary
A new design library for a design paradigm made to bring us from 2D interfaces into 3D interfaces. I've been calling it "Raymorphism," like skeuomorphism or neumorphism. 
The central idea is to make objects feel both real and digital. 
Imagine holding a futuristic phone in your hand. It has a hologram projector with shadows from those holograms landing on frosted glass in your hand. It's as though data just exists in the physical realm, with light casting a shadow down on a surface. 
You're holding that slab of frosted glass. It's a physical object. Buttons are therefore _on_ the glass. It's in your hand. You're touching glass, why make it look like a physical button? 
That's the idea. Data, photos, elements you don't interact with, are projected above your control surface, while buttons and text fields are within reach.

Put it in use in a "FunShine" weather app here: https://github.com/danigol/FunShine
